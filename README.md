# ASA Data Visualization with R

## Welcome

This set of notes is for the [2024 American Statistical Association Council of Chapters Traveling Course](https://community.amstat.org/coc/chapterresources/travelingcourse) "[Data Visualization with R]()".

## Abstract

Data visualization plays a crucial role in the data science and statistics workflows. It is fundamental to everything from exploratory data analysis to communicating results. Data scientists and statisticians can better understand data and more effectively communicate their work by understanding how to better visualize their data. Too often, however, visualization is an afterthought.

In this course, attendees will learn the core principles of data visualization and the perception of visual information; the layered grammar of graphics; and best practices for creating effective visualizations. To put these principles to work, attendees will learn practical skills for R programming that improve the quality of their work with many hands-on examples. The course will focus on the popular R package ggplot2 and the reproducible research framework R Markdown/Quarto. After this course, participants will be comfortable using R and R Markdown/Quarto to create effective data visualizations.
